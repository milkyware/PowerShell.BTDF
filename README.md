# PowerShell.BTDF

## Introduction

PowerShell.BTDF is a PowerShell module to work in conjunction with the BTDF packing framework.

It was inspired by the BizTalk ALM project (biztalkalm.codeplex.com) as I've used this before in automated builds and releases of BizTalk applications. These functions are designed to dynamically work out referenced applications and (re)deploy in the correct order to simplify the deployment process

## Description

Due to BizTalk referenced application being unable to be removed without removing dependant applications first, deploying shared applications can be tricky and time consuming. To deal with this, BtsCatalogExplorer is used to query the dependencies of a given BTDF deployed application and build a list of dependencies to be removed and restored.

The partial deployments of BTDF ((Un)DeployBRE, QuickDeploy, etc) are included as well as extras such as (Un)DeployBAM to speed up testing artifacts during development.

The module is completely written in PowerShell allowing you to alter configuration to fit your requirements such as changing the environments.

## Installation

This module is available through PowerShell Gallery and so can be installed using PowershellGet

```Powershell
Install-Module -Name PowerShell.BTDF
```

## Notes

### BTDF Project Requirements

Currently, these scripts rely on the **ProjectName** and **Manufacturer** properties being static values as BTDF uses these to create registry keys to store deployment configuration such as version number and deployment settings. **IncludeSSO** also needs to be turned on. When deploying an application, the installation folder is stored in SSO which this script then uses to work out subsequent projects to (un)deploy.

### Double-Hop

Using this module as part of a remote deployment in a multi-server BizTalk configuration (separate BizTalk and SQL servers) you will encounter issues with **double hop** authentication within PowerShell. A number of **[articles document this](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2013/04/04/enabling-multihop-remoting/)**, however, the commands needed are as follows:

For the server initiating the remote command (e.g. Deployment server)

``` PowerShell
Enable-WSManCredSSP –Role Client –DelegateComputer server
```

For the server receiving the remote command (e.g. BizTalk server)

``` PowerShell
Enable-WSManCredSSP –Role Server
```

The remote command then needs to pass authentication using **CredSSP** e.g.:

``` PowerShell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName "computer" -Credentials creds -Authentication CredSSP
```

## Known Issues

### MSBuild slow to return

Due to using Start-Process and MSBuild spawning other processes, MSBuild can be slow to return all of the child processes resulting in the finished building hanging
